      <description>two mistresses life and death one wants what I have the other my breath
who is who? which loves me? feels like they’re above me? will it be that will judge me?
sisters, so similar they love my spirit want to hear it be near it
life listens, she speaks she does so gracefully ever patiently ever wakefully
wake up lumpy one day caught, now death’s say pray come what may</description>

      <description>It struck me as true  as just the way that it goes  for the path that I saw  was not the one that I chose
Yet something changed  somewhere sometime  now life is all flowers  and everything&amp;rsquo;s fine
So take a deep breath  and wait just a bit  for soon you&amp;rsquo;ll see  they&amp;rsquo;re quite full of it!
Your heart will get bigger  your flowers will grow  your seedlings will blossom  and life will just flow</description>
