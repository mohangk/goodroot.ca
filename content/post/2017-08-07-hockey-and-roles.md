Hockey is a beautiful sport. Like many younglings who were born in Western Canada, I was raised in part by hockey rinks. Little did I know that the sport of hockey would teach me some of the most valuable life lessons and become an integral aspect of my character.

In hockey, there are 6 players from each team on the ice at once. Each side has a goaltender, two defensemen and three forwards. Among the forwards two of them are wingers and one of them is a centreman. Among the pairs of wingers and defenders, each contains a left-side and right-side.

A team hosts three pairings of defenders, four lines of forwards, two goaltenders - a starter and a backup - and an extra player, either a 7th defensemen or 13th forward. A hockey team, then, consists of 21 players plus three coaches, trainers and equipment staff. And within this 21-person unit, there are two flavours of "special teams".

Special teams are the penalty kill and the power-play. When someone takes a penalty, they are banished from the ice into the penalty box where they watch their team play short-handed and feel shame. When a team is short-handed the penalty killers are dispatched to thwart the other team's power-play. The power-play is the showcase for a team's most illustrious and valuable offensive players.

The power-play is where the most goals are generated per minute. Nothing build confidence, instill joy and heal all wounds like a goal. Nothing gets the adrenaline going or the confidence flaring like putting the rubber biscuit into your enemies basket. A goal is the sweetest point. Everyone wants to score the goal. Everyone wants points. Everyone wants to be on the power-play.

In your 21-person team you will have two power-play units, each containing five players. Unit 1 is the paycheque. Unit 1 is the marquee. I never played on Unit 1. Alas, I was not the one filling the net, rifling pucks into the top-shelf where mother kept the peanut butter.

At the dawn of the tween years the hockey world forks. Players must choose: will you take the full-contact, competitive, focused, disciplined 'Rep' path or the less-competitive, more casual - but still demanding - 'House' track? I chose rep hockey.

In rep, your best players play the most. High performance, good behaviour and impeccable fitness are expected. It is within rep hockey where I experienced the forming of an effective hierarchy. It is within that hierarchy where I learned to devote myself to playing a role. I had to learn that not everyone an score the goals and play on the power-play.

In both the professional and amateur ranks, you need a balanced roster with various player types or you will never succeed. You cannot win with a team of goal-scorers just as you cannot win with a team of full of players who play defense! Each role is needed. Each role is essential.

Even though I loved to skate, I didn't have the best 'hands' - which is to say, I lacked the finesse, coordination and awareness required to be an effective offensive player. "_If only your hands moved as fast as your brain!_", my coach said to me once. It was clear I'd need to carve out a different niche.

I had to learn tenacity. I would always stand up for my team mates, my gloves often flailing off in a flurry of fists. I prided myself on shutting down the other teams' best players and killing penalties. In the defensive zone, I'd do anything to put my body in-front of the puck to prevent it from hitting the goalie. The goalie was more padded and better suited, but that didn't seem to matter. My team mates liked me and respect me. The coaches did too, even if the scoresheet did not.

It didn't look good. It didn't _feel_ particularly good on the body. But I loved my role, I loved the game, I loved my team. I didn't get the goals and the clout that came with them.

If you work as part of any team, whether you're trying to win trophies or build software, you'll need a team of people who know and can buy into their roles.  In the same way that not everyone is cut-out to score goals, a winning organization needs more than merging-home the sweet pucks of a fruitful, cryptic pull request.

In technology, I don't see many high functioning teams. "Soft" skills and roles are denigrated and often disrespected. Entire groups of people, trades and schools of thought are labelled sub-optimal because they appear to not provide technical benefit.

In this life, we all get humbled. The world needs grinders, defensive-defenders, goaltenders and  goal-scorers and alike. While the accolades, the social value and the rewards will distribute unevenly, a team is a living, breathing, dynamic entity.

The grinders of technical team are those who take the time to write documentation, polish up onboarding, keep the morale high. The defenders are those who can say no and standup for the things which they believe in, so that developments can adhere to a moral compass. And 

I lacked skill and talent but learned to apply speed, defense and physicality. I became a leader, someone who made those around him feel better and those opposed to him feel worse. I didn't score goals. I left his ego at the door and my heart on the ice. In hockey, he was respected for it.
