      <description>Many years ago, I had my life transformed by a silly book about cleaning. It was called The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up and it was written by tidy-master Marie Kondō. Marie suggests taking a step back from your busy life, breathing deeply, then decluttering your life in one ruthless material purge.
To become happier, more productive, and less stressed, she teaches one how to craft a simplified existence surrounded only by the things that spark joy within.</description>

      <description>Communication is an exchange of ideas and emotions. When working remotely, our primary vehicle for communication is text. Is this healthy? We&amp;rsquo;ll look into a few passive aggressive manifestations to better prepare ourselves for the weird feelings Slack might give us. Then, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can do better.
You may have heard the adage that: &amp;ldquo;over 90% communication is non-verbal&amp;rdquo;. The original study by Albert Mehrabian describes a 55%/38%/7% formula to describe human communication.</description>

      <description>As someone who has hired many-a-folk into remote teams, I am often asked: &amp;ldquo;How do I get a remote job?&amp;rdquo;. Many are inspired by the luxurious, jet-setting allure of the Digital Nomad. Others just want to break away from a commute, escape the drudgery of a typical 9-to-5, and be closer to their families. Whatever your reasons, I hope to help you remote-enable your journey through life.
Working with YC-based start-ups and a couple &amp;lsquo;major&amp;rsquo; technical companies, I have welcomed many into the remote-working world.</description>

      <description>Growing up, I devoured fiction. Quality fiction, perhaps not, but my imagination received stimulation none-the-lesser. If, within these novels, I found something that sparked my spirit I could then head to the computer to let my mind run, wild and deep, into the unknown. There was a webpage for everything one could dream of.
As a youth, I enjoyed the abstract. The more bizarre and uncommon the plot-line, the more I longed to sink my teeth into it.</description>

      <description>For as long as I can remember, I have told people that I am allergic to penicillin. Whomever discovered my allergy discovered it on the first day of my life. I was given this broad-spectrum anti-biotic, despite being healthy, at birth.
Penicillin is a common anti-biotic, created from penicillium mold. If you find yourself afflicted with any sort of bacterial infection, your doctor may prescribe you this medicine.
I was one healthy and hilarious little creature.</description>

      <description>A new machine sat atop the stairs, on a polished wooden table. The space that stored cabinets stuffed with receipts and documents now played host to a top of the line computer: a plastic-forged modern marvel of technology, infused with whirring sprockets and pulsing with electricity.
I gazed in awe during the machine&amp;rsquo;s unveiling; the cathode ray tube would soon flicker to life for the first time. I was excited, well aware of the digital delights that laid in wait.</description>

      <title>After Ayahuasca</title>

      <description>One year ago, clothes were jammed into a backpack and a plane ticket was purchased for Iquitos, Peru. In the Amazon jungle, I spent a week with Shamans drinking Ayahuasca. My life has transformed. I am going to share with you my experiences re-integrating back into life after Ayahuasca.
 “Life lived in the absence of the psychedelic experience that primordial shamanism is based on is life trivialized, life denied, life enslaved to the ego.</description>

      <description>Growing up, my parents painted an intriguing picture of life after sprouting into adulthood. “I was out of the house at 18!”, my father would remind me. Having now grown well past the age that my parents were when they flew from their nests… then owned their first home… then had children… I feel that living in a one-bedroom apartment with questionable asset accumulating potential and no seedlings makes me look soft by comparison.</description>

      <description>When you tumble down the programming rabbit hole, you will notice the effort taken to encourage others to begin their journey into the programmatic arts.
You will see boot camps, offering to turn you into a developer of mythological proportions in just six weeks. You will see thousands of people cruise through the first steps in Codecademy, or Khan Academy.
Stack Overflow, community Slacks, and IRC channels will be loaded with new comers seeking wisdom.</description>

      <title>The Hacker Who Drank Ayahuasca</title>

      <description>In the ‘90s, everyone was weird. The weirdest among us shuffled off the coil of reality entirely. We were the age-less, culture-less, state-less, God-less generation raised by the Internet… which is to say, we were raised by each other.
The reason for departure differs from person to person: Your parents fought. You had an unusual face or were unsightly. You had weird hair or were full of too many idiosyncrasies. You wanted to learn the ways of technology.</description>

      <description>It was 13 years ago when Whitethumbs and I first met, waging virtual war late at night within a crowded voice chat server. We were both young. Myself, 13. Whitethumbs, 14. We both had a passion for competitive gaming. We made fast friends, as we were both goofy and talkative. Little did I know the impact this friendship would have on my life.
After a joyful, silly night of gaming began to wind down, we decided we should exchange contact information to play again another night.</description>
