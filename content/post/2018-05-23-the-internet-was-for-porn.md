I am a child of the Internet. The allure of its borderless edges, never-ending stories, unrelenting novelty, and limitless supply of companions won my heart and captivated my imagination. The Internet is heralded as the greatest collaborative engineering effort in human history.  But it is much more than that. It is the mirror within which we see our reality. It is the final platform for our conflicts and outrage. And it is rocketing us towards our spiritual evolution.

Growing up, I saw culture work to establish reality. There was a plan. By going to school, being quiet and confining my perspectives into a curriculum, I was taught that I could succeed within it. This is science, this is history, this is how you write, this is how you behave. The plan told me one thing. The Internet told me another.

The Internet of today is tidy. Monolithic structures have risen like beacons of order. Your friends live in Social Networks, your games can be found here in Windows and these are the videos we recommend for you. All of your content collected in aggregate based on your interests. The plan again.

Before, there were no beacons. There was no plan. You would see flickers of light in the distance. But as often as you would find light, so too would you find darkness. If you were searching for games, you would find out how to cheat. If you were looking for friends, you would find combatants. If you were looking for horror, sexuality, gore and depravity, you would find it. If you were not looking for horror, sexuality, gore and depravity, you would find it, too!  

In days, more emotions, more feelings and more experiences than are fit for a lifetime. What happens to a young soul when it is exposed to the oddest flavours of human truth? How can it reconcile what it has seen?

It cannot! It splits in twain. A piece of it goes to school and has conversations at the dinner table. A piece of it hardens and keeps exploring. An innocent young thing, clad in fleece jammies, eating a bowl of cereal. An explorer of the most dire, black and wretched truths known to a species.

People are angry. Cause, after cause, we claw at each other and spit vitriol. The destination is equilibrium. All of our stories, every possible human narrative, each and every one will have its champion. Every personality will be tried.

We do not need to be educated on the relativity of truth, to remind us that the world is many shades, that there are always more questions. We can now sit back, flick through a glowing screen and witness it all. The red, the blue, the black, the white, all culminating in an endless flow of brilliant mud. Our thoughts - it seems - are no longer valuable.

We are experiencing the sunset of intellect. With the aid of dazzling machines we will soon master the tangible experience. There is great work to do. But mastery is within our grasp. We can meet the needs of every person on the planet.

The sun can provide us with power. Our ingenuity can continue to produce efficiencies and artworks that celebrate and inspire the imagination. We can return to natural balance with our Earth. We can realize our dream of dancing into the cosmos. But what will we be when we get there?

Ancient and brilliant spiritual philosophies and modern psychologies share a common thread. They define a construct: our thoughts, the mind, the ego, the self; the thing with many names. Beyond the thing is the watcher: the observer, our spirit, the truth; God.

We are not our thoughts. We are what is behind them. We are what is watching the story of self unfold. And together, behind these narratives, in that entity, we are the collective. We can see this when one focuses inward to spirit. We can break the illusion. We are not what we _think_ we are. We are not what other people _think_ we are.

Identifying this ego, this story, the self-construct, was once a challenge. It took a therapist to help one peer into their subconscious and unearth their patterns of thought, their creations. Or it took deep spiritual practice or decades of diligent self-documentation and cultural revolution. But to see it now, to learn its tricks, to see the folly of its desires and passions, we need only look at the profiles we craft for ourselves.

We have uploaded the ego into the magical machine that we clutch in our hands. And when we gaze into our profiles through glowing glass, what is it that is seeing? It is the watcher, the spirit. The more clear this becomes, the easier the skin is to shed. And when we leave, we leave together.
