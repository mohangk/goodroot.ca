<li><strong>1: Baseline</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It takes a certain oddness to ingest a psychedelic mushroom every third evening. Looking at the studies and reading the anecdotes of others who have embraced the weirdness, microdosing appears an alluring offer. When you apply <em>outside</em> perception of the experiences, things get dicey. I&rsquo;d like to speak more on that, then get into the work done to establish a baseline before under-taking this experiment; after-all, if you&rsquo;re going to do something people think is silly or even dangerous, you might as well document your experiences and explain yourself.</p>

<p>Really science-y things can be boring. To avoid that path, I&rsquo;ve cherry-picked quotes from reputable studies. I attempted to find negative studies, but found none.</p>

<p>From Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28585222">Potential Therapeutic Effects of Psilocybin</a> by Johnson and Griffiths; a lovely longitudinal take&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For mood and anxiety disorders, three controlled trials have suggested that psilocybin may decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychiatric distress for at least 6 months following a single acute administration. A small, open-label study in patients with treatment-resistant depression showed reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms 3 months after two acute doses. For addiction, small, open-label pilot studies have shown promising success rates for both tobacco and alcohol addiction. Safety data from these various trials, which involve careful screening, preparation, monitoring, and follow-up, indicate the absence of severe drug-related adverse reactions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From several Universities: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637246">Effect of psilocybin on empathy and moral decision-making</a> by Pokorny,  Preller, Kometer, Dziobek, Vollenweider, a positive conclusion I found to be hilarious:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These findings provide first evidence that psilocybin has distinct effects on social cognition by enhancing emotional empathy but not moral behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When trying to parse out <em>why</em> people feel better when opening themselves to mystical trips, Martin and Nichols from LSU Health Science in New Orleans reported in their paper: Lifetime experience with (classic) psychedelics predicts pro-environmental behaviour through an increase in nature relatedness, that&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These acute molecular processes also influence gene expression changes, which likely influence synaptic plasticity and facilitate more long-term changes in brain neurochemistry ultimately underlying the therapeutic efficacy of a single administration to achieve long-lasting effects. &ldquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re someone like me who is interested in chasing away the vapours of depression and anxiety, looking at psychedelic and psilocybin studies with a set of analytical eyeballs must pique your interest. Now, you&rsquo;ve decided that you&rsquo;re comfortable experimenting. When you begin to tell people, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see their responses. I no longer see a need to keep entheogenic pursuits in the closet, it&rsquo;s uncomfortable and makes me feel as though I am not representing my truth to the world.</p>

<p>For me, a white Northern Canadian fellow with naturally occurring dreadlocks growing from his skull, my friends and loved ones give me the: &ldquo;<em>Oh, of course you are</em>&rdquo;-sort of response. The same  endearing response I receive when I tell people my favourite restaurant serves Caribbean food and that I prefer not to eat meat. Living in a liberal and relaxed part of the world the undertaking isn&rsquo;t really a big deal. But, when it comes to my more Southern colleagues and acquaintances, I feel inclined to keep my experimentations more to myself.</p>

<p>Psychedelics are not for everyone. They open you up to realities and experiences that challenge the very structure upon which we build our prejudices, preferences and priorities. Mushrooms, in larger doses, are a direct threat to the construct many refer to as <em>the ego</em>. It would be a significant challenge to write upon this topic without having a frame like the ego for reference.</p>

<p>There are a few interpretations of ego. When I refer to it, I mean your architected sense of self. The thing that thinks it&rsquo;s David, Sarah, or Bruce and not Timothy, Brittany, Chair-leg, or Squirrel.  It is a machination of immense complexity. From the moment you&rsquo;re conscious inside the womb, your ego begins formulating how it will navigate the world. It is not an evil construct, though you may have heard someone be referred to as <em>egotistical</em>, as a pejorative.</p>

<p>The ego exists to protect you as a singular entity during your time on this earth. It&rsquo;s an organization of your experiences, wishes, and desires; past, present, and future. It can be overt: your running dialogue, the character that acts as you within your minds eye. Or, it can be subtle, subconscious. The quick, negative decline of that invitation you just got for skiing because of that one time at the slopes you fell and your friends laughed at you. The internalized status-quo would be disrupted if you went skiing, thus you shoot-off an unfavourable response when your presence is requested up at the hill.</p>

<p>Large doses of psychedelics can blow this construct to smithereens, causing it to bobble on the floor, it&rsquo;s eye-glasses strewn aside, whimpering   in an alien tongue whilst trying to re-assemble the careful work creating the tangle that was <em>you</em>. This can be a healthy experience. It can be a re-birth. An opportunity to become the Hero and the Author of a new story that you write for yourself. A new beginning, one untethered to the limiting beliefs that your old ego has constructed; the old patterns that had been created to protect <em>you</em> as you tried to figure out how you were going to navigate your existence, where on the social ladder you wound up falling.</p>

<p>Here I sit, at the beginning of a new chapter. As I write a better story, microdosing has a role to play. It will help keep my egoic construct soft and malleable. Careful, precarious work for one who cares deeply about his mind, indeed. To ensure cool-runnings I&rsquo;ve spent several months establishing a baseline. I&rsquo;m comfortable with goofiness, but I hope to keep my colouring inside the lines.</p>

<p>To establish a baseline, I began two activities with regularity. First, meditation. A session while I wake up and a session before falling asleep. The morning session helps me organize my dream-life. What was rolling around my head, did I fall asleep with ease, was I stressed, what was I thinking about; I observe all of these assessments, marvel at their perfection, then let them go. Before bed, I reflect upon the day: what happened, what did those situations mean for me, which emotions did I feel, how did I make others feel; they roll around, perfect, then depart.</p>

<p>The second activity is journaling. Apart from this public-facing series, I have begun keeping a private journal. I journal after meditation, both in the morning and in the evening. To me, the act of journaling is cathartic. I love to write. When you engage in meditation, your mind can expand and the chatter and disarray - even the calm - can sometimes feel overwhelming. Journaling feels like lassoing all the ineffable nuances of an untethered mind and condensing them into human-readable chunks. The entries are nothing fancy, they&rsquo;re quite simple. The real magic of journaling comes from referring to <em>old</em> entries.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, I was in a bit of a foul mood which persisted for a few days. I wrote about what had irked me across several entries. Today, before writing this, I re-read those entries. How silly I felt! What had troubled me so then means so little today. Thumbing back through the emotions and experiences of history gives me an immediate dose of perspective.</p>

<p>The final ingredient in baseline establishment comes in three parts: a healthy diet, a vibrant routine, and a comfortable environment. I eat a diet made mostly of plants, which is my choice. I start the morning with fruit, eat a couple salads, raw-food, or cooked dishes throughout the day. My fridge is always stocked with a bounty of fresh things. I won&rsquo;t prescribe a diet or impose moral-choices, but I will suggest consistent meals that make you <em>feel</em> good.</p>

<p>Meals are one part of a routine; exercise, meditation, defined hours of work, socialization, enjoyment of nature; craft a somewhat stable calendar. If you travel for work or often wind up in stressful situations or situations that require intensive levels of coordination &ndash; other than video games, you will need to be careful with respect to when you&rsquo;re dosing and understand what, if any, level of physical impairment you feel. Structure is not for everyone, but I feel it enables me to more easily let my mind be free; I&rsquo;m not wondering where my food is coming from, whether my health is good, or whether my friends are alright, I know.</p>

<p>The last part is a comfortable environment&hellip; <em>Aaaaahhhh</em>&hellip; Your home should feel like your kingdom. Do you have a space for play? Are the interfaces you interact with in your computers and living spaces free of clutter and chaos? A conscious arrangement of your worldly possessions can do wonders to make you feel at ease. Similar to the benefits of structure, surroundings that I know are safe, organized, clean, and fun are a joy to spend time in.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until all of the above could be described as <em>smooth sailing</em> that I felt it was time to welcome the mushroom into my life. While your friends might not understand, it&rsquo;s important to be sensitive to and to take care of your needs. If you go about it with diligence, love, and sincerity, who can say you&rsquo;re making poor life choices? It&rsquo;s been a good week so far but I feel like any experiential reports would be swayed by placebo and novelty. Next time, perhaps!</p>
