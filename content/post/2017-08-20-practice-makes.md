I no longer visit distracting applications. The frothing battlegrounds of social networks: gone. Aggregators with dubious ranking algorithms and suspect turf composition: so long! Once focused and objective tech media outlets: adios. My reading list has been replaced with a deeper peace.

Why? I felt trapped, stressed and stagnant. I felt that if I didn't ride the wave then I would fall behind the curve. I believed that my job would vanish, that the robots would take over and that the rare chosen few -- those who learned _that little bit extra_ -- would be their handlers instead of me.

I had convinced myself that I was _interested_. I told myself that this is my hobby and that I _loved_ spending my weekends programming and reading books to improve my performance and productivity. And I had always heard that the "best work" gets done by those who love what they do.

But this obsession was not love. It was fear and insecurity. I feared being irrelevant. I worried that my wave would dissolve into meaninglessness. And I had to stay ahead, always watchful for the next thing that would swell up behind it.

I began to wonder what **patterns** I was building as I filled up my reading list and clicked my life away. I saw what attracted me: the allure of potential. I had become obsessed with the future, the next thing. And so, I saw a pattern **deference**.

**Deference** is a dark pattern. It happens when you defer an experience in the moment in exchange for an illusory one tomorrow; procrastinating, the tomorrow or next hour that never comes. It is an abstraction, an impossible destination.

The present is where challenge and struggle dwell. And we must experience them to activate our potential. But lusting after the future caused me to avoid challenge and struggle. I had lost touch with the present. This is a lesson stress taught me.

It is Wednesday afternoon. I am exhausted; it's been a long week already and I am carrying stress. On Wednesday I'd tell myself: "On Friday, I will relax".

Wednesday comes and goes and I would remain distressed. Thursday the same. But no worries: tomorrow is Friday. And when that day comes, it will be time to relax.

Friday, sweet Friday arrives. Time to relax! But did I? Could I? When have I practiced relaxation? Does this mean I'd stay up late reading articles, getting through that reading list? Learning, improving, producing?

My being cares little what day it is on the calendar. To it  there is one day, one time, one moment: right now. If I wanted to relax on Friday, then the time to learn relaxation was Wednesday when I was in the midst of stress. And when Friday arrived then I would have done it already. I would _do_ it.

We are unable to **defer** relaxation just as we can not defer learning. We can not defer self development. If I want to learn, then I have to stop. I have to pick something -- and then learn it, deeply -- right now!

Patterns do not come when called. They are woven through time, encoded deep into your being. And if you defer patience and lose the perseverance to develop meaningful skills, then you will never grow. You will click through struggle into something else.

> “We humans are unhappy in large part because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we want, we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires.”
