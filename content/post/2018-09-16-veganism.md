I grew up on the Canadian prairies. As early as the first grade, we had milk day. Such a joyful day! You took a form home to your parents and they filled out what sort of milk you would receive. Chocolate milk? White milk? Mmm - what joy.

As the milk cart rolls in, each student receives a bag full of colour trinkets and stickers along with their carton of fresh milk. One such sticker could be seen on many a car bumper: I <3 Alberta Beef. Milk is great for you! Beef is delicious! Let us be strong and healthy, together.

You learn about what is right for you in great detail. Milk is a part of the food pyramid, you see? Right next to the beef, the green vegetables, and the wheat -- all the things we eat. If you eat all of these things then you will have strong bones and teeth. You do not want your teeth to fall out, do you? You want muscles and to be strong, right boys? Then you should wash your steak down with an ice cold glass of milk.

You learn about the cow. You have a sticker of a cow. He is smiling. One sits atop your pencil. He is not a steak yet. This cow is wearing sunglasses.

The cows love to give us milk. The farmer takes a pail, sits next to the cow, pats her gently on the shoulder, and then squeezes her utters to exhume the milky, teeth growing liquid. And the beef? Cows get old, you see, and we do not want to be wasteful -- ... so we eat them.

In the first grade, you would not know what to make of artificial insemination. You would not know whether or not the antibodies and hormones contained within was suitable for your consumption. Do I have the nutritional needs of a baby animal which has four stomachs and will weight well over a tonne? If the cows have a baby, what happens to the baby? If I drink _its_ milk, what does it drink? You have none these questions. You have but one important one: Chocolate milk or white milk? Mmm - what joy.

Machines milk cows. Machines impregnate cows. People take calves from their mothers, sometimes sticking their heads into bars to prevent any growth of muscle mass. Without muscles or tension in the body, you can render meat of unprecedented tenderness. Those unlucky baby cows turn into _veal_. But you just know that _veal_ is fancy. If you do well, if you make lots of money, then you can afford to eat veal.

Or the calves could become new milk cows, kept healthy through antibiotic treatment, living out a fraction of their life span, producing perhaps littles veals of their own, eventually winding up as tasty beef chuck or flank steak. That delicious slice of red meat, right there in that red square in the food pyramid, the pyramid around which you should plan all the meals that you eat. Take your milk, dear children, take your pyramids and your stickers.

The myth of the friendly farmer is a compelling story. We are taught to believe that our needs are filled without cost. We are taught that if there were cost, then it is justifiable because that is what we need to survive. When we look through this story, we see the tentacles of the free market. Milk day is to sell beef and milk to children.

We buy deep into these myths. We believe that meat and milk are dietary staples without which we become weak and waifish. We are scared into thinking that without milk, we will be frail and breakable. If we do not eat meat, we do not fit into the template. We will not have enough protein to be strong athletes or intelligent students. We have scaled unimaginable horror and torment to fulfill these myths. The myths keep the money flowing.

Once you are aware of the depths of the myth, you might concede: I can not dispute the unpleasantness. But they are just animals. We need to eat them to survive. I care not for the "feelings" of a fish, cow, chicken, or pig. I am not even convinced of the existence of those feelings. I buy organic, local, free range, grace fed; I eat how I eat and I like it.

A position of this nature is one of deep and temporary selfishness and privilege. Not only does it assert the dominance of our wellbeing over that of other lifeforms, it marginalizes the vast environmental and spiritual cost. We will need to produce more animals for more meat. More animals, more feed. More feed requires more wild land to become farmland. Farmland needs more water. We are already _too far gone_ -- will your children be able to eat this way? The means to assure such requires the continued success of the Western ideologies of wanton consumption. The success of these ideologies and the wellbeing of the planet are inversely proportional. [Meat comes at a devastating environmental cost](http://cases.open.ubc.ca/environmental-impact-of-meat-consumption/).

The environmental cost is nothing to that of the spiritual. A mother cow will not cry out the name of its calve as it taken from her. A pig, wading through its own refuse, does not pontificate whether it was meant for bigger and better things. A chicken whose beak has been stubbed and talons has been clipped will not cry tears as it is pumped full of steroids and fed until its legs break. An animal can not tell you _why_ it is suffering. The heart, the rightness, breaks and the spirit is tormented all the same. An animal suffers.

And you consume this suffering. A life - a creature, an offspring - experiences travesty and then you place it within you. You think to use this animal as a fuel. You think to only consume its flavours, its proteins, and its fats. Yet many still sit and wonder, why does depression plague me so? Why do anxious thoughts run throughout my mind? I eat my meat, I live my life, I make good choices -- but something is wrong, something is wrong, something is wrong, something is wrong. I must numb this pain. I feel trapped. I feel dirty. I feel sick. Something is wrong. If you listen, you can hear that this torment, this screaming in the dark corners of your mind, are their spirits. For as long as you perpetuate misery, it will be a part of you.
