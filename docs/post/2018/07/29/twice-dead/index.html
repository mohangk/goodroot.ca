    <pre><code>                      When I was done dying,
                      my conscious regained
                      So I began the struggle,
                      a nothingness strained
                            - Dan Deacon
</code></pre><p>I was the class clown of the third grade. You could never coax me into sitting still. I would leap to make people laugh, to joke, make a silly noise or a do funny impression. But when I changed schools in grade four, that changed. This is a story of my two deaths.</p>
<p>I arrived at my new school the me that I had been and started off with a bang. I was the gregarious, hilarious, obnoxious, tenacious and wild-haired boy and I adored the role of the ‘new kid’. But the reality of the pack and the hidden cruelty of hierarchal younglings would soon present itself.</p>
<p>One day a much larger boy known for his size and passion for Brazilian Ju-Jitsu approached me. He had a smaller, smirking, freckle-faced crony at his side.</p>
<p><em>“Tell me a joke,”</em> he demanded.</p>
<p>Not one to shy away from an opportunity to conjure a smile, I performed the most impressive joke in my repertoire. The sure thing. But no laughter came.</p>
<p><em>“…That was <strong>not</strong> funny…”</em></p>
<p>Silence followed.</p>
<p><em>“Now [OTHER_BOY]&hellip; you tell me a joke.”</em></p>
<p>He tells a joke. The intimidating Brazilian guffaws. A hearty and earnest chuckle.</p>
<p><em>“Well, it looks like you are <strong>not</strong> funny. [OTHER_BOY] is <strong>really</strong> funny.”</em></p>
<p>And so it was. Death to the funny boy. But being funny is who I am! If I am not the funny boy, then which boy am I? Over time, I learned to become different boys. I became the computer boy, the gaming boy, the story-telling boy, the hockey boy, the sad, alone and depressed boy. I grew, as kids do. Sad, but not yet my first death.</p>
<p>In 2009, I was three years removed from High School. More a man than a boy, but still ever-changing in the confusion of early adulthood. As reproductive and social strategies failed, newer, bolder ones took their place. Over and over. Until one day everything changed.</p>
<p>After a whirlwind of uninspired, unfocused and uninteresting attempts at post-secondary education, I went through a series of moves. I relocated from my family home to a shared townhome, back into my family home, into a different townhome, into a basement suite, and then into a friends place. Until, at long last, my own apartment with a room-mate.</p>
<p>My few things were moved within an hour. I plunked my mattress onto the floor, arranged my clothes in the closet, and put my computer onto a desk. I stepped into the shower. I started washing my hair. And then I broke into pieces.</p>
<p>A personality is what we show to the world. It is us, our self: me, I. The personality is our story of who we believe ourselves to be. How are our personalities created? Through experiences, through time.</p>
<p>The beautiful machine of gray matter within our skull computes this self-narrative with impressive consistency. It creates your presence, the abiding belief that you are you, a living thing, whole, attached, here, relevant and alive. It is vast and powerful, yet not immune to failure. In the shower that day, for <em>me</em>,  the system crashed.</p>
<p>In an instant, there was no character. There was no self. No personality. No I. A recursive mess of null madness: self-references, referencing self-references which lack definition. The primitive gears in my mind remained alert: panic, horror, flight. Something is wrong. The system is down. I sat on the floor of the shower, water pelting my head.</p>
<p>Where am I? Who am I? I… I know my name. I am me. I went to this school and I was… Funny? No, I <em>was</em>. But I had to stop. I was… athletic? No, that was my brother. I was… smart? But what do I know? I don&rsquo;t know anything. How can I be smart when I know nothing? Who is talking? Who is thinking? What is thinking? What is talking?</p>
<p>I remained there for what felt like an eternity. There was no time. I had no answers to these questions. There remained only a strange sense of observation and screams from my animalistic senses.</p>
<p>As the weeks went by my mind returned to normal. But the operating system had changed, a fundamental alteration to the underlying source code. I now understood the existence of consciousness separate from the idea of personality, the idea of me. I had heard about these moments from books and meditative teachings. But the experience was pure, harrowing madness. It was psychosis, a breaking of the self. This was my first death.</p>
<p>This moment of eternity changed me. I moved into my own apartment. No roommate. I explored music. I worked on my mental health. I practiced meditation. I changed every relationship I had and became the sole owner of my life, responsible for writing my own narratives. But there was a knot. It was bleak, heavy, and afflicting. A black mass. An error, deep, deep in the code. I felt it time for the code to be re-written.</p>
<p>I needed help creating a better self, telling a better story. I learned of entheogen like Ayahuasca and how they can change your state of being. My journey into mind and science culminated in an experience with this ancient medicine, deep in the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>In the Amazon, I watched the entire program unfold. I saw the methods that inform the unfathomable depths and distance of space and time. I met with eternities and I spoke with the programmer. We were together, we fixed me, watching, and then <em>I</em> fell apart again. But the error was found, the bug eradicated, and something new written.</p>
<p>The self can die to madness. It can die to entheogen. It can die to deep meditation. It can die as all will do. My third death, whenever it may come, may be my final death. And from it, I may never return. But I fear not, for it is only my self that will cease.</p>
