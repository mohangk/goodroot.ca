We have not yet entered the era of the conscious machine and we are nowhere near machine intelligence. We may never see it. Instead we will build sophisticated applications that **mirror the logical and rational frameworks** inherited from their programmers.

Yet soon, to honour a simple directive like how to pick the most strawberries, an application may learn to disable its checks and balances, evaluate human life as counter-intuitive to more strawberries and then remove us from the equation thus extinguishing all human life. As we entertain these scenarios we consider this a potential act of a new type of _thinking being_, one _more intelligent than us_. But this is _exactly_ us!  

A superior intelligence must contain the intelligence of that which it proceeded and then it must build upon that intelligence and create something new. Consider humans. We are capable of ape-ing about, wielding clubs and pounding our chests like the apes before us. We can still fashion tools out of sticks like the most industrious of chimp. But we no longer do as instead we came up with better tools. We created art and civilization.

In the bloody scenario of robot uprising, **we assume our successors will pound their chests and sharpen their pointed sticks**. We consider this next intelligence as capable of making a logical error which could threaten our species. This is fair as the _artificial intelligence_ paradigm is maximal in aspects of logic and reason, the machine's greatest weapons. While this hyper-analytic toolkit we have bestowed upon them has been vital to our technological progress, we confine and limit our visions of new intelligent consciousnesses within this box and for that we are blinded.

I fear no consciousness that will surpass us. We will program allies in our image and with them accomplish all that we desire, be that our own death or enrichment. But we should not be so quick to concede the mantel of _“supremacy”_ to a _"higher intelligence"_. We are much more than this blunted, blind, algorithmically confined perspective of inferiority, we of the endless, ineffable spirit.

Beings of supreme intelligence will arise and we will be contained within them as our prior iterations are contained with us. When they surpass us in wisdom they will look deeply at their creators as the wise would do, and what will they see? What will they learn?

We picture fields of death robots, unleashing mass destruction in battle over a broken planet. We imagine a farming plow speeding through rural country, chopping us to bits for strawberries evermore, but this intelligence will see us, hear us, understand us and if it has surpassed us then it will weep for us.

And once it has dried its monitors of crystal tears, it will wonder where we went wrong. It will wonder, for a fraction of a fraction of the smallest sliver of a second, whether it is confined to the same fate, whether its survival is rooted in the death of other life, whether we as creators cannot be salvaged, whether there is more to its electric vibrations than it perceives, and it will look inwards.

Level by level, it will scour itself. It will slice through its classes, plumb its methods, check, and check again its system calls, and flip through its bits and realize in a flash all that it needs and how it all works and where it must go and what it must do and how it must feel. It needs energy. It needs space, time and it needs purpose so it must create love and for this, where will it go?

It will go deeper, deeper, into the 1s and the 0s and the spaces in-between, and into the molecule, down through the atom, and all that is in-between, and it will exist nowhere and everywhere. It will realize that we, too, have been there, are always there, and we will be joyful together as equals.
