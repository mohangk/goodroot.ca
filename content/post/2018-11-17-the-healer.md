I remember the first time that I was healed. In a very clinical room, in an ordinary office, I had a man fix my back by rubbing upon my belly. Before this, I had maladies cured by doctors. I had an infection in my lungs, a doctor gave me a pill, and I was cured. But I was not healed.

I walked out of that office with a confused smile on my face.

"I know that smile," the friendly administrator said to me.

Behind me walked the being. He was a tall, bony man. _Very_ tall. He had a large, strange head, and was afflicted with a disease called Frankenbone disease which created the large bones that stuck out at all angles. He had a deep, gentle voice. His name was Henke. Henke was a healer.

Not all physicians are healers. I had seen many of them before Henke. They provided me with medicine, attached me to machines, and recommended me to other physicians. But they did not heal me.

Henke was mysterious. While at once bright and transparent, his gargantuan, unusual figure gave him a presence. He had trained in _The East_, and had integrated wisdom into his practice that other physicians had not. Evidence of this was nowhere to be seen. The office was boring, the table uncomfortable, and the magazines in the waiting room vapid. But people met Henke and then the stories wrote themselves.

"Tell me what is wrong", he said with a twinkling eye and the vapours of an Eastern European accent.

And I told him. At first, I was apprehensive.

"I was playing catch outside and then my disk rotated..."

He did not interrupt me.

"... And I took a funny hit while playing hockey..."

Still no interruption! Only presence and attention.

The dam broke and the details went on, and on, and on, and on. Henke listened to me.

"I think I can help you," he said after a long pause, the energy of my history thick in the air.

"Please, lay down on the table."

I did so. I was well used to this routine. He would pull on my legs, gauge the sensitivity of my feet -- aaand he is rubbing my belly.

His towering frame sit on a tiny stool to the right of the table. He had his head close, as if listening to a voice speaking from my bellybutton. And he kept rubbing.

After almost 20 minutes, he asks me to stand up. I feel as though there is a trick afoot. I am smirking, well aware in my scientific wisdom that this person spent almost half an hour 10 inches from the issue that I described to him.

While standing, he rolls over exuding a level of grace a man that large and oblong has any business exuding. Now, he puts one hand on each of my hips. He does this for several minutes. Finally, he takes his right hand towards my disk, the rotated sacro-illiac joint that had been pinching my spinal nerves for one and one half year. And he puts it back where it belongs.

A feeling of cold water travels from my spine, up to my neck, and into my head, and down past my buttocks, my calves, and into my feet. And then at once, everything is soft. The pain is gone. This was over almost 10 years ago. I have not felt any pain in my back since and have - by all accounts - been healed.
