It struck me as true </br>
as just the way that it goes </br>
for the path that I saw </br>
was not the one that I chose

Yet something changed </br>
somewhere sometime </br>
now life is all flowers </br>
and everything's fine

So take a deep breath </br>
and wait just a bit </br>
for soon you'll see </br>
they're quite full of it!

Your heart will get bigger </br>
your flowers will grow </br>
your seedlings will blossom </br>
and life will just flow
