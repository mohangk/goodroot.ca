Today I am saddened to hear about the passing of Dr. Paul Roberts. Paul had a significant impact on my life. As 2017 opened up, I found myself at a cross-roads. All this technical skills and successes, all these offers to further technology for technologies sake or pad the pockets of some swindling businessman. Where's the spirit? What's the point? I felt the need for guidance.

My plea led me to the [Alianza Arkana](http://alianzaarkana.org), a non-profit working with the indigenous Amazonian Shipibo people and the plant medicines of the rainforest. And the Alianza led me to Paul.

I never wound up working with the Alianza Arkana. But I did speak with Paul at length about things of all sorts, exchanging modern technical wisdom for profound and ancient insight. If you are interested in getting to know a dearly departed mind that explored deep into long lost forms of consciouss, [Paul's blog](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com) is fascinating. 

Before passing he wrote a three-part, 10,000 word paper. It is worth reading.

**Earth-Beings, Plant Spirits, Ayahuasca and Equivocations**:

* [Part One](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com/2017/04/23/earth-beings-plant-spirits-ayahuasca-and-equivocations-part-one/)
* [Part Two](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com/2017/05/07/part-two-earth-beings-plant-spirits-ayahuasca-and-equivocations/)
* [Part Three](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/part-three-earth-beings-plant-spirits-ayahuasca-and-equivocations/)

Thank you, Dr. Roberts. Rest well, my friend. 

May you find yourself in good company among the Other Beings.
