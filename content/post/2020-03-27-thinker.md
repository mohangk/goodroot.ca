It struck me as true
as just the way that it goes
for the path that I saw
was not the one that I chose

Yet something changed
somewhere sometime
now life is all flowers
and everything's fine

So take a deep breath
and wait just a bit
for soon you'll see
they're quite full of it!

Your heart will get bigger
your flowers will grow
your seedlings will blossom
and life will just flow
