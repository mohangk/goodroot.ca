The most difficult question that I am asked is: _"What do you want?"_

The answer - for as long as I can remember - is... nothing.

Being alive is the greatest thing of all.

I am grateful for the moment.

Yet it is time to answer that question.

**There are things that I want while I am here.**

I want to...

* share the gift of meditation

* help heal other beings and our planet, however I may

* prepare delicious food for other beings who struggle to find it

* help other beings through life's final moments

* dance and play

I am here to help no matter what you believe.
