    <p>Words have power. And we can lose control of words. They can spiral out of control, becoming vast and overwhelming abstractions. These abstractions, through misunderstanding and careless use, then have a profound impact on the world around us. This is series looks at a word and then hopes to reduce it back to reality. This post looks at the word: opinion.</p>

<p>Three definitions of opinion:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>a view, judgment, or appraisal formed in the mind about a particular matter</li>
<li>belief stronger than impression and less strong than positive knowledge</li>
<li>a formal expression of judgment or advice by an expert</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>People seem uncomfortable having opinions. I have had people tell me with pride that they have weak opinions and hold them weakly. I have had others declare that they hold no opinion of any kind. But I&rsquo;m dismayed: strong opinions are not less virtuous than weak opinions and there is no wrong in having them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“All opinions are not equal. Some are a very great deal more robust, sophisticated and well supported in logic and argument than others.” ― Douglas Adams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An opinion is not a fact. A fact is verifiable. The cup weights 1lb. You can put a cup upon a scale and prove that it does weight 1lb. But an opinion is akin to a belief. An opinion is a working theory.</p>

<p>If an opinion is - according to Merrian-Webster - ‘a formal expression of judgment or advice by an expert’, then why do we frown upon them? Do we not trust the experience of the experts we hire or the colleagues we keep? It seems we do not. We have decided that we want data, fact; show us the proof!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure [PERSON_X] will have lots of opinions.
We didn&rsquo;t get a lot done. There were too many strong opinions!
[PERSON_Y] is so opinionated.
I&rsquo;m not comfortable with people who have strong opinions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the expression of an expert’s knowledge and experience is their opinion, it should be valuable. But this seems to be changing. We are skeptical and resistant to opinions.</p>

<p>The idea of the strong opinion has been positively conflated with the assertive, bold, courageous; and negatively conflated with the domineering, the masculine, the arrogant, the egotistical, and the strange.  And not for poor reason, an opinion is an organized package of thoughts. Sometimes the package is positive and creative and sometimes it is negative and destructive.</p>

<p>Sometimes I might just want to <em>do</em> something, but someone else has an idea, an opinion.  And it can be frustrating! They do not know what I know &ndash; so, perhaps they are missing something; they are running in one of their old patterns; they are not looking at the data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.” ― Nassim Nicholas Taleb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ted Kaptchuk, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School wrote a fascinating article titled the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1126323/#ref16">Effect of interpretive bias on research evidence</a>. There were three main points.</p>

<p><strong>a: evidence does not speak for itself and must be interpreted for quality and likelihood of error.</strong></p>

<p>kjkljklk</p>

<p><strong>b: interpretation is never completely independent of a scientist&rsquo;s beliefs, preconceptions, or theoretical commitments.</strong></p>

<p>People  bend to fit ideas into their own cultural narratives. This is as natural a human tendency as breathing. The observer will always be present within their observations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are incapable of forming such opinions.&rdquo; ― Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>c: on the cutting edge of science, scientific interpretation can lead to sound judgment or interpretative biases; the distinction can often be made only in retrospect.</strong></p>

<p>The decision you make at a point in time is only proven a “good” or “sound” decision over time. Inception of an idea - even when its source is empirical data - does not provide immediate verification of the conclusion. The conclusion can only be reached once an observation marinates through time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed the passion is the measure of the holders lack of rational conviction. Opinions in politics and religion are almost always held passionately.” ― Bertrand Russell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we can’t trust opinions, what can we trust? I believe that we <em>can</em> trust them. But we need to understand the folly of clinging to <em>any</em> belief or interpretation. This is part of team-work. It’s part of creating a culture around what happens when something goes from ideation to creation.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve come across these thoughts from engineering circles, you’re likely well paid. And you might be an expert, too. You <em>should</em> have strong opinions. Summon your experience, intuition, education and available data and present it to the world with measured grace. Hold and respect your strong opinions without guilt, fear or shame.</p>

<p>But when a new package of ideas arrives to challenge it, let it go. First, the new idea needs to do work. The onus is on <em>it</em> - the new - to demonstrate that it is more sound, more considerate. If it did not provide a new perspective and sound ration, then don&rsquo;t give up yet. Don’t let the battle end just because of who is offering it or because it&rsquo;s smooth on the surface. Explore it. Question it. Be curious about it. Be sure. But give it a chance. If it succeeds, concede.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If the facts don&rsquo;t fit the theory, change the facts&rdquo; - Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Challenging opinions will often appear with a precision that can take the legs of even the most robust theories. And you&rsquo;ll need to learn and pull your self-worth out of your ideas. You are not your ideas. If you are wrong, or right, or half-wrong, or some-what right, it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Do not let others bully you into insecurity, telling you that you&rsquo;re opinionated or stubborn. Do not pay heed to those acting self-righteous because they’re too cowardly to hold unique opinions. Your opinion will do nothing but reflect positively upon you if you trust your heart, think lucidly, and put forward well-distilled, logical, and rational arguments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be strong. Create a vision. Lead others. Have strong opinions. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re just fleshy, compliant automaton.</p>
