It struck me as true. The way that it goes. </br>
The path that I had and not the one that I chose. </br>

Yet something changed, somewhere sometime, </br>
now life is all flowers, though they are not mine. </br>

Give it a sec, give it a bit, </br>
and soon you'll see they're quite full of it. </br>

Your heart will get bigger, </br>
your flowers will grow, </br>
and you'll start planting seedlings, </br>
row upon row.
