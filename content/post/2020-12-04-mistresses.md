two mistresses
life and death
one wants what I have
the other my breath

who is who?
which loves me?
feels like they’re above me?
will it be that will judge me?

sisters, so similar
they love my spirit
want to hear it
be near it

life listens, she speaks
she does so gracefully
ever patiently
ever wakefully

wake up lumpy one day
caught, now death’s say
pray
come what may

think: "prepared"
her whisper: "infinite potential"
revelations torrential
scared

alive again
we remain three friends
for my mind, at least
a bittersweet release
