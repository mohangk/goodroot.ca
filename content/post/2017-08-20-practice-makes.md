My reading list has been replaced with a deeper peace. I have had enough of this overwhelming flood of fleeting technical knowledge masquareding as valuable skill. Why? I feel trapped, stressed and stagnant. I feel that if I don't ride this wave, then I will fall behind the curve. I believe that my job will vanish, that the robots would take over and that the rare chosen few -- those who learned _that little bit extra_ -- will be their handlers instead of me. That I will be lost, unemployable, and left out.

How did I get here? I had convinced myself that I was _interested_ in riding this never-ending wave. I told myself that this is my hobby and that I _love_ spending my weekends programming and reading books to improve my performance and productivity. And I had always heard that the "best work" gets done by those who love what they do, so of course... I "love" it!

But this obsession is not love. It is fear and insecurity. I fear being irrelevant. I worry that time to shine, to earn, will dissolve into meaninglessness. And I have to stay ahead, always watchful for the next thing that can swell up behind me.

I look at my **patterns** I am building deep ones as I fill up my reading list and click my life away. I see the attraction that lured me here. It is the allure of potential, of usefulness, of profit. I am obsessed with the future, the next thing. I don't like this feeling, and I give the pattern a name: **deference**.

**Deference** is a dark pattern. It happens when you defer an experience in the moment for something illusory: the next thing, the tomorrow.

For example, imagine it is Wednesday afternoon. I am exhausted, it's been a long week already and I am carrying stress. On Wednesday I'd tell myself: "On Friday, I will relax".

Wednesday comes and goes and I remain distressed. I click, click around, distracting myself, working, toiling. Thursday the same. But no worries, because tomorrow is Friday. And when Friday comes, it will be time to relax. _Ahhh_ -- I have earned it!

Friday, sweet Friday arrives. Time to relax! But can I!? What does that even look like? When have I learned how to do it? Is this that relaxing time where I can stay up late reading articles, those "longer" articles, getting through that crucial reading list? Restful learning, improving, producing?

My being cares little what day it is on the calendar. To it, there is one day, one time, one moment: right now. If I wanted to relax on Friday, then the time to learn relaxation was Wednesday when I was in the midst of stress. And when Friday arrived then I would have done it already. I would have the skills _do_ it. But I don't, because I **defer**.

We are unable to **defer** relaxation just as we can not defer learning. If I want to relax, then I have to get off this wheel of madness and learn to pattern relaxation, in the moment, every single day. I have to return to the present, breath and let go. And if I want to learn, then I have to stop. I have to pick something -- and then learn it, deeply -- right now! Not later, not when I feel I will have this time I will never get.

Patterns are woven through time, and they are encoded deep into your person. If you defer and lose the perseverance to develop meaningful skills then you will never grow. You will never learn to sit with the moment and blossom. You will just keep clicking through struggle into something that feels easier. Tomorrow never comes. Relax today. Stop.

> “We humans are unhappy in large part because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we want, we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires.”
