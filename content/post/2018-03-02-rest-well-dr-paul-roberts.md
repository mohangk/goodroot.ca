Today I am saddened to hear about the passing of Dr. Paul Roberts. Paul had a significant impact on my life. As 2017 opened up, I found myself at a cross-roads. All this technical skill, all these offers to further technology for technologies sake. Where is the spirit? What is the point?

A door opened up to me after a brilliant blog post compelled me to reach out to its author. My plea for guidance led me to the [Alianza Arkana](http://alianzaarkana.org), a non-profit working with the indigenous Amazonian Shipibo people and the plant medicines of the rainforest. That author was Paul, the director of Alianza Arkana.

I never wound up working with the Alianza Arkana. I did wind up speaking at length with Paul about things of all sorts, exchanging technical wisdom for Western-psyche shattering insights. I did not know it then, but I understand it now: the mentorship been with me all along.

If you are interested in getting to know a dearly departed mind that illuminated new frontiers of consciousness exploration, [Paul's blog](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com) is fascinating. Before passing he wrote a three-part, 10,000 word paper that shares some fantastic ideas.

**Earth-Beings, Plant Spirits, Ayahuasca and Equivocations** by Dr. Paul Roberts:

* [Part Two](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com/2017/05/07/part-two-earth-beings-plant-spirits-ayahuasca-and-equivocations/)
* [Part Three](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/part-three-earth-beings-plant-spirits-ayahuasca-and-equivocations/)

Thank you, Paul. Rest well, my friend. May you find yourself in good company among the Other Beings.
