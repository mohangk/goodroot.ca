      <description>There is a pandemic. I am asked to stay within my home. It is different but not different: I am asked to avoid the market, travel, time with friends and to keep my distance from other people. People are scared, but outside the birds seem unbothered.
The days blur together and it is weeks and a month and more. My alarm goes off and it is hard to get up. It takes all of my will and strength to ignore the fear.</description>

      <description>Vacation reading is my favourite. When commitments disappear and the pace of life slows down, there are few things more rewarding than diving into new ideas. The ideas of this vacation came from Deep Work by Cal Newport, but they were not so new.
 &amp;ldquo;Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It&amp;rsquo;s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time.</description>

      <description>I grew up on the Canadian prairies. As early as the first grade, we had milk day. Each student took a form to their parents and filled out which milk they would receive the following week. Chocolate milk? White milk? One carton? Two cartons?
Next week arrived and the milk cart visited each student. It delivered fresh, cold milk and a bag full of colourful trinkets and stickers. The most famous sticker could be seen attached to car bumpers throughout the city: I &amp;lt;3 Alberta Beef.</description>

      <description>When I was done dying, my conscious regained So I began the struggle, a nothingness strained - Dan Deacon I was the class clown of the third grade. You could not convince me to sit still. I would do antyhing to make people laugh, to joke, make a silly noise or a do funny impression. But when I changed schools in grade four, all of that changed. And so, this is a story of my two deaths.</description>

      <description>You have applied Shamanism, but no one would have told you that’s what it was. Yet there are at least two Shamanic methods of consciousness exploration that people often experience. The first is lucid dreaming.
 “Shamanism is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.” - Shamanism, wikipedia.</description>

      <description>Growing up, I devoured fiction novels. Something within them sparked my spirit. I would take their inspiration to my other salvation, the computer, and let my mind run, wild and deep, into the unknown. There was a webpage for every thing one could dream. And I had wild dreams.
I enjoyed the abstract. The more bizarre and uncommon the plot-line, the more I longed to sink my teeth into it. One of the many series of abstract children&amp;rsquo;s fiction I consumed was titled: The Zack Files.</description>
