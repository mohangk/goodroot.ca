<li>1: <a href="https://goodroot.ca/post/2017/08/15/microdosing-baseline/">Baseline</a></li>
<li><strong>2. Affect</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Today is day 15. In my first two entries, I strayed away from discussing <em>how I feel</em>. The placebo effect is potent; I was concerned that the novelty of the experience would sway my interpretation. For those who haven&rsquo;t read the previous two entries, dosing takes place every third evening. Today, we&rsquo;re going to get roll into the affectual response to Psilocybe semilanceata.</p>

<p>Mushrooms are a powerful psychedelic substance. Even with a dosage as small as .022 grams, when they&rsquo;re ingested their presence is palatable. The effect, while subtle, persists during the off-days. We&rsquo;ll take a look at each day.</p>

<h2 id="day-1-dosing">Day 1, Dosing:</h2>

<p>Doses are taken during the evening - after dinner, when apartment upkeep has been completed. I&rsquo;ll measure out the mushrooms, eat them, then wash them down with water. They have been ground into a fine powder to ensure consistency at the chemical level; eating a nibble of a cap versus eating a nibble of a stem could render a significant disparity in active Psilocybin.</p>

<p>After one hour, there is an onset period that last about four hours. This is when the affect is most pronounced.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Slight dilation of the pupils</strong>. Not enough to <em>look blasted</em> but enough that when I look at myself in the mirror, I appear&hellip; Engaged. Or, perhaps aroused - present and accounted for, a light is on in the attic.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Exposed dimples</strong>. A slight, somewhat goofy smile appears upon my face. It&rsquo;s playful and receptive.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Contentedness to Mild euphoria</strong>. An ever-so-slight current of energy rolls outward from my heart. It&rsquo;s pleasant!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Open and talkative</strong>. Often times, as is natural in technical and writing trades, I spend prolonged periods of time <em>within</em> myself. I believe introversion to be part of the creative process. In contrast, I&rsquo;ll feel compelled to vocalize and express myself to whomever will listen. It&rsquo;s a bit strange for me, to articulate myself and gesticulate with wild enthusiasm upon my inner-workings. This is a positive of great magnitude.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Increased focus, reduced distractibility</strong>. I&rsquo;ve been working towards a more simple life. I no longer carry a &ldquo;smart&rdquo;-phone. I&rsquo;ve stopped reading content aggregators. After dosing, I went to be <em>in</em> something. Whether it&rsquo;s intertwined in expressive conversation, inside a virtual world, a book, or some writings. When I&rsquo;m there, I&rsquo;m there. I&rsquo;m not looking forwards to <em>the thing after</em>. I&rsquo;m more present-minded.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Empathetic and gentle</strong>. I&rsquo;d characterize this as: enhanced awareness of my own energetic output. If I&rsquo;ve acted in a tenacious manner or been careless with my interactions, I feel mirrored empathy. If my words have caused disharmony in someone or in an environment, I feel an equivalent pang of sadness in my own heart. The result is a more gentle and careful demeanour. For me, this is helpful. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for my filter to fall off and for my razor-sharp Western Canadian hockey-locker-mouth to make an appearance.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Dreams</strong>. Dreams become more lucid. Sleep feels <em>deeper</em>. The imagery feels clearer, less scattered, random, and fragmented. I write a journal every morning and evening, morning entries I attempt to relay dreams to the best of my ability. I feel dreams follow a more coherent narrative, now.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Minor sluggishness</strong>. Induced contentedness can bring about malaise. If you have high exertion fitness routines, for example, you may feel less inclined to blast off to the weight rack. I&rsquo;d consider it a mild intertia. For the sake of comparison, it&rsquo;s less present than with cannabis; a soft undercurrent which can be worked through.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Hot flashes</strong>. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to feel a fleeting <em>hotness</em>, almost to the point of sweatiness. A flushed feeling can appear in my chest and face. It&rsquo;s a minor down-side, but it reminds one of their chemically altered state.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-2-dose-1">Day 2, Dose + 1:</h2>

<p>During Day 1, immediate dosage presents a clear bump in mood. Day two is subtle, almost undetectable. If it weren&rsquo;t for the <a href="https://goodroot.ca/post/2017/08/15/microdosing-baseline/">care taken to establish a baseline</a>, I would be unable to articulate past: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel that different, just kinda better!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s too subtle, even, for clear bullet points. Metaphor, it shall be.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re creatures of <a href="https://goodroot.ca/post/2017/08/20/practice-makes/">pattern</a>. We <em>are</em> the patterns in which we&rsquo;ve practiced, consciously or subconsciously. Considering our thoughts as a path through a dense jungle, we traverse through it as we go about our day. When we learn new things we hack through the overgrowth, making a new path. When we engage in routine, we travel down the same road that smoothes out into a safe and comfortable path over time.</p>

<p>We should be careful, then, which path we tread down. While microdosing, I&rsquo;ve noticed something analogous to a fork in the road. If a situation comes up where old, perhaps unwanted patterns exist, the ease of the road makes it easy to choose those patterns over new ones.</p>

<p>Before, if my ego were to feel threatened, I&rsquo;d consider a typical left-turn through the shady yet smooth path of angst, anger, and jealousy. This, despite the fact that the path to the right, while inhabited with dense brush and creatures unknown, glows much brighter.</p>

<p>The mushrooms compel me to take the brighter path, a new path into love. The forests seem to give way; no longer needing to be hacked and contended against. The creep recedes and a path appears to lead me into the sunny unknown. The journey is not without struggle: challenge, with a playful sense of ease. Those dark, old roads need not be tread.</p>

<h2 id="day-3-dose-2">Day 3, Dose + 2:</h2>

<p>Similar to day 2. I detect no crash, no dip in mood to compensate for the relative glow of the prior two days. My body feels softer, stress doesn&rsquo;t accumulate within my shoulders and neck; hazards of the keyboard bound trade. Thoughts and feelings linger much less than they otherwise would.</p>

<p>If I have a negative experience or interaction, release is not far behind. Rumination is no longer a requisite phase of processing. Darkness comes, it&rsquo;s observed, and it goes &ndash; which is an important thought upon which to close this writing.</p>

<p>Microdosing and psychedelic experiences do not negate the presence of bad thoughts. There is no healthy immunity from the full human emotional experience. If there were, I&rsquo;d not wish it upon my worst enemy.</p>

<p>Feelings are <em>more</em> apparent, not less so. Darkness is <em>more</em> vivid, not less so. I believe entheogenic substances like Psilocybe semilanceata help the mind and the heart stay open.</p>

<p>You need not dwell on failure, sadness, or defeat. The way of darkness may become clearer but so, too, will the way of light. When you can see both with open eyes, the choice is yours which path you&rsquo;d like to take.</p>
