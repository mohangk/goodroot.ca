One year ago, I jammed my clothes into a backpack and purchased a plane ticket for Iquitos, Peru. In the Amazon jungle I spent a week with Shamans drinking Ayahuasca. It changed my life.

The psychedelic "non-ordinary realities" are not for the faint of heart, yet they are not much different than the experiences had growing up within an unfiltered Internet.  

We built a strange and brave new world. It is a marvelous, instantaneous, bright and fast world where vibrant minds bleed their creative fluids. We stare through retinas scorched by electronic light and few stop to wonder about the cost of off-loading wave upon wave of our words, thoughts, pictures, and talents into clouds of server-racks.

This great machine is built by the tired fingers of those who sing line after line of machine-language into the ether and yet it is unfulfilling because someone else moves faster and the jobs start to disappear and the planet gets warmer but there is a picture of a cat! And the Earth is dying.

The consumer mind has never been more satisfied. Each notification or byte of new information results in a refreshing spritz of dopamine — the good stuff. Keep clicking. Keep reading. No messages, feel awful. The only thing worse than receiving 100 emails is receiving 0.

Addiction is inadequate in describing the rampant need for novel information. It is a merciless and unbalanced signal-to-noise ratio. Over time, this is how I coded myself to become numb and dark. A thousand hooks demand my attention and my brain is elated and happy to be useful. My wary heart tries to follow, tricked by the problems I think I want to solve and I tell myself "I am helping build a better world." Yet I do not.

I feel there must be more to life. I feel my spirit needs saving. I feel an insatiable curiosity and a desire for goodness and it leads me down a different path towards spiritual enlightenment. I learned about meditation and it became my lamp against the growing darkness and it took me to places of nature and solitude and taught me lessons. I complete Vipassana.

It was within the trees where I first feel real connectedness. I do nothing, yet I feel at peace. It is through being useless that I start to see that I manufacture the reality where I am useful. My emotions, my reactions, choices and my opinions all contribute to the smothering fog within which I live. I feel better.

I integrate back into the technical world, yet I am now more sensitive. My mind feels as a lake, once thrashed by storm, now calm and still. New thoughts appear as gentle ripples along its glassy surface.

Each run-in with ‘ego’ casts a stone into my waters and each careless word disturbs the surface. I wonder why people are so hectic. I wonder when small things became so important. Splashes, waves, ripples.

My new sensitivity makes the contrast devastating. I had seen peace but now I return and feel chaos. I feel that life will never make as much sense as it did in the forest, where tranquil eyes lazily traced the grooves in the tree bark. I feel trapped and I fall even deeper into depression. My sea is storming again.

They tell me I am a valuable corporate asset. I am reminded that my skills are lucrative. I am told I am going to be successful. I feel a corkscrew enter my entrails and it twists. My mind is slower and more simple but its thoughts become black. I read about Ayahuasca and I forget about it.

Later I read another article, and another, and I click click into another link and read it and it sends shivers up my spine. It is the story of depressed woman who drinks a hallucinogenic potion in the Jungle, gets blown apart, then meets God. She learns that there is no separation and then she never feels depressed again.

I am a sober-minded, intellectual, technical person and so this does not compute. I think she speaks in metaphor. I know she did not meet anyone after drinking a jungle potion and that it happened in her own mind, and that she created a mechanism to process and solve her own problems. Yet I am separate and special and valuable and my depression is more complicated, and did I mention that I am an intellectual? Although the seed is planted and little do I know, I would meet Lady Ayahuasca.

The Shaman is an absurd profession, they are a practitioner of madness. Before the potion, I see people with drums and shakers and I think they are improvisational musicians: singing, whistling, and pounding to a tune only they can hear and that makes sense only to them.

_"There are unfathomable numbers of spirits, alternate dimensions intertwined with our existence, infinities of healing love and light from which you came and will return,"_ the Shaman tell you.

I am an intellectual and I think this sounds absurd. The Shaman hands me a cup filled with potion and he sings to it and I smile a patronizing smile. I sit on my blanket, as I always have, as I harken back to my infantile human comforts. I drink it.

After the potion — for the first time — I see truth. I am not a strong enough writer and I believe that not with the largest choir or the most radical band or the greatest cohort of artists, could anyone ever articulate the experience of being granted a mere peek into this substance which stretches endlessly into the ‘it’.

> And without even thinking cast me into space / But before she did that she wiped off my own face / She said better luck next time don’t worry so much / Without ears I couldn’t hear I could just feel the touch — Dan Deacon, ‘[When I Was Done Dying](http://amzn.to/1pds3wR)’

I hear with my ears and I see with my eyes. I taste with my tongue and touch with my skin. I feel an activation of some ansible hidden behind my eyes and everything is weird. I try to speak but my boxy language is only a bottleneck towards any understanding. I experience crushing leagues of love, light, wisdom and life.

My sense of self is the person I am. It is the one who likes blue coats, nice shoes, and fancy dinners, the one who stares at its phone when around strangers, the one who is bullied at school, the one who neglects their children and is mean to its parents. These are not all me yet they are the one who just had every molecule of their being blown apart, dissected, and re-arranged by love-filled inter-dimensional beings.

This is weird and I feel I do not believe these things, and I try to click and click and I want something else and I want to believe again in sugar, caffeine, alcohol, television, and the reality that teachers and the news teach me about. This is a metaphor. I know this is not a metaphor.

My life changed and it is permanent and no memories of darkness remain. The black I lived in disperses into vapours and becomes a vague memory of someone else’s bad dream. I am here, I am back. My soul came with me and my heart, mind, and spirit live together in the present. I am whole. I am joyful. I am ecstatic.

I feel I need to change everything. Desk job? Flying Eagle. Management? Wild Dog. Cynicism? Blue Bird.

I expected nothing but I know now. Ayahuasca reconnected me with the important things in life. Loving myself, loving others and living in harmony with nature.

From one natural thing, one animal, one explorer, one human to another: your soul misses you and it has a universe of beautiful and strange things it would like to show you.
