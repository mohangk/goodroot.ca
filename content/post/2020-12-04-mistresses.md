                        two mistresses
                        life and death
                        one wants what I have
                        the other my breath

                        but who is who?
                        which loves me?
                        feels like they’re above me?
                        will it be that will judge me?
                        
                        sisters, so similar
                        they love my spirit
                        want to hear it
                        be near it

                        life listens, she speaks
                        she does so gracefully
                        ever patiently
                        ever wakefully

                        but wake up lumpy one day
                        caught, now death’s say
                        pray
                        come what may

                        I think: "I'm prepared"
                        she whispers: "infinite potential"
                        revelations torrential
                        scared

                        feel alive again
                        we remain three friends
                        for my mind, at least
                        a bittersweet release
```
