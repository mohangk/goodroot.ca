* **1: Beginnings**

It takes a certain oddness to ingest a psychedelic mushroom every third evening. If you're going to do something people think is silly or even dangerous, you might as well document your experiences and explain yourself.

Really science-y things can be boring. I've cherry-picked interesting quotes from reputable sources to add some spice. I attempted to find negative studies to bring balance, but found none.

From Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine: [Potential Therapeutic Effects of Psilocybin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28585222) by Johnson and Griffiths; a lovely longitudinal take...

> "For mood and anxiety disorders, three controlled trials have suggested that psilocybin may decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychiatric distress for at least 6 months following a single acute administration. A small, open-label study in patients with treatment-resistant depression showed reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms 3 months after two acute doses. For addiction, small, open-label pilot studies have shown promising success rates for both tobacco and alcohol addiction. Safety data from these various trials, which involve careful screening, preparation, monitoring, and follow-up, indicate the absence of severe drug-related adverse reactions."

From several Universities: [Effect of psilocybin on empathy and moral decision-making](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637246) by Pokorny,  Preller, Kometer, Dziobek, Vollenweider, a positive conclusion I found to be hilarious:

> "These findings provide first evidence that psilocybin has distinct effects on social cognition by enhancing emotional empathy but not moral behaviour."

When trying to parse out _why_ people felt afterwhen opening themselves to mystical trips, Martin and Nichols from LSU Health Science in New Orleans reported in their paper [Lifetime experience with (classic) psychedelics predicts pro-environmental behaviour through an increase in nature relatedness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28631526) that...

> "These acute molecular processes also influence gene expression changes, which likely influence synaptic plasticity and facilitate more long-term changes in brain neurochemistry ultimately underlying the therapeutic efficacy of a single administration to achieve long-lasting effects."

I no longer see a need to keep entheogenic pursuits in the closet. It is uncomfortable and it makes me feel as though I am not representing  truth to the world. It is also nothing short of an insult to positive spiritual and intellectual inquiry. When I tell people, the responses are fascinating.

As a Northern Canadian fellow with naturally occurring dreadlocks growing from his skull, my friends and loved ones give me the: "_Oh, of course you are_"-sort of response. It's the same endearing response I receive when I tell people my favourite restaurant serves Caribbean food and that I prefer not to eat meat. Living in a relaxed part of the world, this undertaking isn't a big deal. But when it comes to my more Southern colleagues and acquaintances, I feel inclined to keep my experimentations more to myself.

Psychedelics are not for everyone. They open up realities and experiences that challenge the very structures upon which we build our prejudices, preferences and priorities. In larger doses and more elaborate ceremonies, mushrooms are an existential threat to the construct many refer to as _the ego_.

There are a few interpretations of ego. When I refer to it, I mean the architected sense of self. The thing that thinks it's David, Sarah or Bruce and not Timothy, Brittany, Chair-leg or Squirrel.  It is a machine of immense complexity. From the moment you're conscious inside the womb, it begins formulating how it will navigate the world. It is not an evil construct. It is essential. And tricky.

The ego exists to protect you as a singular entity during your time on this earth. It's an organization of your experiences, wishes and desires: your past, present and future. It can be overt: your running dialogue, the character that acts as you within your minds eye. Or it can be subtle, subconscious and inconspicuous.

Psychedelics in large doses can blow it to smithereens, leaving fleshy limbs bobbling on the floor, eye-glasses strewn, whimpering in an alien tongue whilst trying to re-assemble the tangled, knotted thread of _you_. This can be a healthy experience. It can be a re-birth. Or it can be a nightmare and a catalyst for the unstoppable degradation of self. In smaller doses this is much less of a risk. It becomes a more gentle ally, a light companion with you on your daily adventures.

As I write a better story, microdosing has a role to play. It will help my egoic construct soften. I care deeply about my mind and so I recognize that this is careful and patient work. I have spent several months establishing a baseline to ensure cool runnings. I am comfortable with more silliness. But I hope to keep my colouring inside the lines.

I have two supporting activities. First: meditation. A session while I wake up and a session before falling asleep. The morning session helps me organize my dream-life. What was rolling around my head, did I fall asleep with ease, was I stressed, what was I thinking about; I observe all of these assessments, marvel at their perfection, then let them go. Before bed, I reflect upon the day: what happened, what did those situations mean for me, which emotions did I feel, how did I make others feel; they roll around, perfect, then depart. I observe.

The second activity is journaling. Apart from this public-facing blog, I have begun keeping a private journal. I journal after meditation, both in the morning and in the evening. The act of journaling is cathartic. I love to write. When engaged in meditation, my mind can expand and the chatter and disarray - even the calm - can feel overwhelming. Journaling feels like weaving all of the ineffable nuance into human-friendly chunks. The entries are nothing fancy, they're quite simple. The real magic of journaling comes from referring to _old_ entries.

Several weeks ago, I was in a bit of a foul mood which persisted for a few days. I wrote about what had irked me across several entries. Today, before writing this, I re-read those entries. How silly that was. What had troubled me so then means so little today. Thumbing back through the emotions and experiences of history gives me an immediate dose of perspective.

The final ingredient in baseline establishment comes in three parts: a healthy diet, a vibrant routine and a comfortableÂ an safe home environment. I eat a diet of mostly plants. I start the morning with fruit, eat a couple salads, raw-food or cooked dishes throughout the day. My fridge is always stocked with a bounty of fresh things. I won't prescribe a diet or impose moral-choices, but I will suggest consistent meals that make you _feel_ good.

Meals are one part of a routine; exercise, meditation, defined hours of work, socialization, enjoyment of nature; craft a stable calendar. If you travel for work or often wind up in situations of high stress or that require intense coordination, you will need to be careful and responsible when you're dosing and understand your level of impairment -- if any. Err on the side of caution!

Structure is not for everyone, but I feel it enables a more free mind; I'm not wondering where my food is coming from, whether my health is good or whether my friends are alright. I know.

The last part is a comfortable environment... _Aaaaahhhh_... Your home should feel like your kingdom. Do you have a space for play? Are the interfaces you interact with in your computers and living spaces free of clutter and chaos? A conscious arrangement of your worldly possessions can do wonders to make you feel at ease. Similar to the benefits of structure, surroundings that I know are safe, organized, clean and fun help catalyze joy.

It wasn't until all of the above could be described as _smooth sailing_ that I felt it was time to welcome the mushroom into my life. While your friends might not understand, it's important to be sensitive to and take care of your own needs. If you go about it with diligence, love and sincerity, who can say you're making poor life choices?
