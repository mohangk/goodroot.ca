      <description>Vacation reading is my favourite. When commitments disappear and the pace of life slows down, there are few things more rewarding than diving into new ideas. And ideas of this vacation was Deep Work by Cal Newport but they were not so new.
 &amp;ldquo;Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It&amp;rsquo;s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time.</description>

      <description>“A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.” —Alan Perlis, first recipient of the Turing Award.
 We have not yet entered the era of the conscious machine. We are nowhere near electronic intelligence. We may never see it. Instead we build sophisticated applications that mirror the logical and rationale frameworks inherited from their programmers.
Applications make decisions based on available data. They may have room to analyze and interpret, but these interpretations are methods born from an existing framework.</description>

      <description>Some ideas shine with truth. One such idea was articulated in 1967 by computer programmer Melvin Conway:
 “organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”
 It is often found in good humour: the system is a mess and the people who made it are a mess. Haha &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s Conway&amp;rsquo;s Law for you! Joking aside, within it holds the potential for a radical leap forward in the development of complex programmatic systems.</description>

      <description>I grew up on the Canadian prairies. As early as the first grade, we had milk day. Each student took a form to their parents and filled out which milk they would receive the following week. Chocolate milk? White milk? One carton? Two cartons?
Next week arrived and the milk cart visited each student. It delivered fresh, cold milk and a bag full of colourful trinkets and stickers. The most famous sticker could be seen attached to car bumpers throughout the city: I &amp;lt;3 Alberta Beef.</description>

      <description>When I was done dying, my conscious regained So I began the struggle, a nothingness strained - Dan Deacon  This is a story of my two deaths. I was the class clown of the third grade. You could never coax me into being still. I would leap to make people laugh, to joke, make a silly noise or a do funny impression. But when I changed schools in grade four, that changed.</description>

      <description>“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” ― Aristotle
 You have applied Shamanism, but no one would have told you that’s what it was. Yet there are at least two Shamanic methods of consciousness exploration that people often experience. The first is lucid dreaming.
 “Shamanism is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.</description>

      <description>Growing up, I devoured fiction. Within these novels I would often find something that would spark my spirit. And then I would take that inspiration into the computer and let my mind run, wild and deep, to expand into the unknown. There was a webpage for every thing one could dream. And I had wild dreams.
I enjoyed the abstract. The more bizarre and uncommon the plot-line, the more I longed to sink my teeth into it.</description>

      <description>I have a deep love and respect for video games. It was a passion developed from growing up glued to a Gameboy. And why not? Games provided a thrill, a challenge and hours of blissful amusement. They were magical contraptions, capable of sating my demanding and hyper-active mind.
Digital escapades were a part of our family legacy: “Remember the time Kellen brought his Gameboy to hockey practice, and sat on the bench playing it instead of skating on the ice?</description>

      <description>In the ‘90s, everyone was weird. We were the age-less, culture-less, state-less, God-less generation raised by the Internet… which is to say, we were raised by each other. And the weirdest among us fell into the strangest of places.
The reasons would differ: fighting parents, an unusual or unsightly face, too much time and not enough attention, an odd mind, strange hair or just too many idiosyncrasies. Some wanted to learn the ways of technology.</description>

      <description>It was 13 years ago when Whitethumbs and I first met, waging virtual war late at night within a crowded voice chat server. We were both young. Myself, 13. Whitethumbs, 14. We both had a passion for competitive gaming. We made fast friends, as we were both goofy and talkative. Little did I know the impact this friendship would have on my life.
After a night of gaming began to wind down, we decided we should exchange contact information to play again another night.</description>
