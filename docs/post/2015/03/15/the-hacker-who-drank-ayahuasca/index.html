    <p>In the ‘90s, everyone was weird. We were the age-less, culture-less, state-less, God-less generation raised by the Internet… which is to say, we were raised by each other. And the weirdest among us fell into strange places.</p>
<p>As for why, the reason would differ: fighting parents, an unusual or unsightly face, too much time, not enough attention, an odd mind, strange hair or too many idiosyncrasies. Some wanted to learn the ways of technology. Some wanted to play. Others wanted to seek for greater truths. Most were lonely.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, these people did not hear the same message that the social world delivered — with tremendous success — to their corporeal peers. All they knew was that there was a mold, they did not belong in it and so they withdrew. And like millions of others they found their solace on the Internet.</p>
<p>In the first grade I had a realization: the previous years&rsquo; institutional sentence was not a one-off occurrence. It was, in fact, a pattern that would continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>One fateful day, after my mother kissed me farewell, I clung to her legs and refused to let go: <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be quiet! I&rsquo;ll be good!&quot;&quot;</em>, I bargained through tears. It did not work.</p>
<p>It soon became evident to my classroom’s matriarch that I had no inclination towards learning, sitting still and behaving like the rest of the faces who were pleasant and neat in their straight and well organized desk rows. Yet this wretched woman had a way of dealing with these things, a magical bullet that would evolve even the most spirited and wily little creature into a calm and phonetically excellent warm body of learning. It came in the form of a pill, one that was proven to be effective.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, a discussion took place behind administrative doors with my parents. If I did not begin my regiment of federally approved medicine, then the school would no longer be interested in attempting to try and educate me. I moved schools.</p>
<p>I met new friends. I moved again, met new friends. A further move&hellip; But this time things were different. Hormones had set in and I withdrew to my bedroom, sullen and alone on the computer, where my eyes were opened and a different sort of life began. Friends appeared from different places: Internet Relay Chat, forums, games, communities — someone was always there, weirder than the last, willing to share things and listen.</p>
<p>Not long after, relationships formed. Hobbies appeared, skills were developed and suddenly a boy becomes a name and transcends his flesh; a conduit for information, channelling unfathomable facts large and small to all possible corners of the world. I, the once inattentive boy, had found an environment that aligned with the rapidity and creativity of my mind. And there were secrets. So many secrets.</p>
<p>Years passed. I gained wisdom, bordering on magic. Some of it dark, manipulative and dangerous. Much of it light: bright, helpful, inspired and altruistic. Alas, this wizardry came not without consequence. Reality, the one I&rsquo;d wake up to, the one that awaited me when I would pack my lunch and leave for work, seemed unbothered by my revelations. It began to feel further and further away.</p>
<p>Social obligations became just that. Gatherings became set pieces, the people within them like actors in a foreign play. The ambitions I embraced in moonlight faded when the sun was shining. Hands full of digital gold became a sore back and a commute. Important conversations with fancy titles: “Chiefs”, “Directors”, “Managers”, became an adventure into patience. How much self-important puffery can I absorb before snapping a spell or two from under a bored breath?</p>
<p>Depression was inevitable; a soul existed in one place, the body in another. A lost scroll of technical talents and anonymous international accomplishments, a resume destined to become cog in a spirit-less machine. And worse, digital friends started to disappear, conscripted into &lsquo;real life&rsquo;. The voices that used to speak the loudest and clearest stopped signing in and trying to build or fix things. I was a man now. It was my turn.</p>
<p>A man needs to find a way to provide for their families and loved ones, they tell me. He needs to learn how to suck it up and fit into modern existence. But I could not, I was too broken.</p>
<p>I fell down a dark path. Yet there was always a small glimmer of light, just out of my reach. Following that light, I wound up in Peru with a plastic cup full of thick, chocolate coloured, freshly brewed Shamanic potion in my hands.</p>
<p>Surrounded by strangers and several traditional medicine men, I felt no fear in the middle of the Amazonian jungle, about to consume the strongest hallucinogenic concoction in the known universe. I brought the cup to my lips and drank.</p>
<p>Comparisons to chocolate exist only in colour. A bitter, bean-like, basic flavour sludged down my throat. The Shamans began to sing and shake their leaf rattles.</p>
<p>An hour passed. A second hour was close. I felt nothing.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Maybe I should drink more&rdquo;</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>The shamans continued to sing and they began pounding on drums.</p>
<p>The thoughts came more rapidly. Why do I still feel empty? I am still lost. My head is still too full, my government is still too crooked, my culture does not fit right and I still feel like I was born into the wrong planet.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The potion did not work for me.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I tried. I failed.</p>
<p>I stand up and head to the washroom. My stomach feels a little funny. I decide to let it pass and then I will go to sleep.</p>
<p>I sit on the toilet in the middle of the jungle and pull my pants down to my ankles. I allow myself deep, seething anger.</p>
<p>Anger for thinking there were any answers in the Jungle that the Internet and a life-sentence of unfiltered knowledge could not have provided me.</p>
<p>Anger for being unable to fit in with peers who seemed to have such different, material and selfish motivations.</p>
<p>Anger for being helpless and unable to change a world so thoroughly broken.</p>
<p>Anger and disappointment for failing to just shut up, be normal and love those in my life who love me. From the fog, a calm voice brings me an unexpected sense of ease.</p>
<p><em>“These are just your demons speaking”</em>, it says.</p>
<p><em>“I know that!”</em>, I snap back, not nearly as calm.</p>
<p>The voice smiles at me: <em>“You asked for this…”</em></p>
<p>A man dies. A universe shatters. A figure appears — or is it two figures? One male, one female. They exist together, infinitely, in an indescribable labyrinth of statelessness.</p>
<p>They encompass everything there ever is, was and will be. Past, future and present possibility appear with them — in them, part of them, behind them, above them, through them. They do not speak but they communicate with impossible precision and clarity.</p>
<p>Any feeble mental attempt to analyze, interpret or translate fails to process — the mechanisms of observation have departed and no capacities remain to contemplate whether they may ever return.</p>
<p>An ancient, patient being exists — as it always has — where the mind of a single man used to be. Understandings beyond comprehension and recollection are folded with immense weight into memory as human emotion and symbolic circumstance. A depth of presence too deep to fathom elegantly weaves the realities of an interconnected and unified existence deep into a consciousness.</p>
<p>Time does not exist here. This is where one came from. This is where one will go. This is where one is right at this moment and in all moments.</p>
<p>A man is aware of his mind again, yet the entity is still with him. Their communication appears to be over but their work is not. The shattered threads of a human-being are wrung out then straightened with grace and love. The entity performs their work with such joyful ease; each twist bleeding out darkness, each re-arranged thread brighter than sunlight.</p>
<p>On some level, a man registers being on the floor of a hallway. Someone helps him into a shower. He is covered in vomit, yet immaculate. He is clean to the pure centre of a soul he never knew existed. He tries to leave the shower but a young boy almost forgotten dives head first into his heart. He falls to the floor complete, crushed with an absolute unawareness of who, what or where, when or why.</p>
<p>What are these clothes for?</p>
<p>Whose language is this? He hears communication.</p>
<p>Does he speak the same language? He tries to vocalize… That did not sound the same. Somewhere a beautiful voice is singing.</p>
<p>A stern yet loving face appears without any earthly attachments. It is clear that this face will be the face who tells him where to go.</p>
<p>A physical body has been returned to its space. Its location, its purpose, its feelings of identity, still too far outside the grasp of any of its senses.</p>
<p>An ensemble of beings now stands before him. They are tall, feminine, angelic, bright, loving, joyful and a bit silly.</p>
<p>Arms of a transcendental length indicate that they are reaching to him from the world from which he has just returned. They rub his back… A gentle shush washes away his anxieties as his mind returns to his surroundings.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Have I been broken?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>“…Shhh…”…</em>, they giggle and embrace him.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Who was that?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>“…Shhh…”</em>, they giggle again, beautiful and full of music.</p>
<p>They laugh because they know his soul is going to be within his body soon, the prior question an indication that his two-eyed humanity is taking hold again.</p>
<p>They stay with him for an eternity. Capable of nothing but love, they accompany every thought back into his mind as he slowly comes to grips with who he is… where he is… what he is. His soul has returned and whatever existed in its place has been released to pure love. Everything is different. He was sick. Yet no longer; the shamans and their allies gave him their medicine. And now he is whole again.</p>
