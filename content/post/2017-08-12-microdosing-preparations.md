Today I embark on a partnership. For the foreseeable future I will be taking 0.2 grams of Psilocybe semilanceata mushrooms every third evening. I'd like to share why I've begun this adventure and think through what I hope to achieve.

Two and a half years ago I still had severe depression. I am a sensitive and introspective being. And I've come to understand that my depression was an appropriate reaction to both my youthful experiences and how I was building my character. The person that I became and the life that I had crafted was out of harmony with my true self.

If you'd have met me, you'd have thought I was a bright and contended dude. But inside I felt rotten. I was numb and miserable; my mind often encouraged me to kill myself. It wove a horrible reality where I felt no one could love me. It took an experience in the Jungles of Peru to shake me out of a dark and suffocating rut. That rut had no future and I am forever grateful to what aided me.

Something left me in Peru. I returned home with an alien lightness. I couldn't believe the depression was gone. But I feared -- as old echoes of the disease ran their course -- that my healing might be temporary.

I have always been hyper-aware of "pattern". I've learned through meditation to apply this awareness of pattern to my own mind. Our personalities are complicated. The permutations we play out every day are an amalgam of the routines that we've habituated throughout our lives. By the time we enter adulthood, the patterns of character are deep. The algorithms are complex, bugs and all.

Thankfully nothing is forever. Character is malleable. This reality is at the center of _Cognitive Behavioural Therapy_ - or, CBT for short. CBT is the re-writing of your reactive thoughts through a volley of responses back and forth between you and your practitioner. Our thoughts colour how we see the world; our words are representative of our thoughts. Lighter, happier, less-charged words, a lighter, happier, less-charged existence.

CBT in conjunction with anti-depressants is a way of reprogramming a character. Anti-depressants provide the chemical grease, CBT re-wires "happier" patterns.

My thoughts on anti-depressants from observing a numb and sad loved-one, my own week long personal experiences and years of research, have led me to believe that they should be avoided at any cost. These medicines damage the spirit in ways that we are unable to -- or care not to -- acknowledge. We do not yet know enough about what they do to carry such a cavalier and careless attitude towards their wide-spread prescription and consumption.

Shortly after taking anti-depressants, I felt them. Through introspection and meditation, I knew my mind well. When I began to feel them "work", I became horrified. This was not _making me happier_ or _helping me best depression_, this was suffocating me, muting the wild colours of my mind: creative, spirited, tenacious; inoculated, subservient, dull.

After a few days, I stopped taking the pills. My emotions returned with a vengeance. I felt and still feel great anger towards those who encouraged me to take this route. I understand why my physician warned that _"things"_ would become worse before getting better, that more suicidal thoughts may be expected; the last screams of a buried soul. I will work to forgive.

Two years after returning from the Jungle, I have become much more aware of the patterns that led to my depression. I understand what they were, where they came from and how they became tied to the darkness which no longer served me. But the deepest, darkest, slyest ones know how to hide.

It takes a concerted and on-going effort to reveal my own self-deception and steer my mind aware from the cultivation of ongoing suffering. The ego is the master of self-deception. We can spend several lifetimes unaware of its fictions. It's taken blood, sweat, and tears to begin writing a new story for myself.

I've completely changed with whom I associate. I've made major adjustments to how I work. I've let go of two failed companies, failed academics, failed identities and failed relationships. I understand who I am now and I love that person. I eat a healthy, mostly-plant diet. I exercise. I spend time with nature. I am outwardly joyful and -- I am told -- help others around me feel happy and comfortable. But there are many things with which I still need help.

A casualty of depression was my sense of play and lightness. I lost that care-free, child-like engagement with the world around me. I long to listen better, spend less time in my own head and engage others with a more open heart. And I dreamed of joining social events without worrying that someone was going to bash another crack into my skull. These are the clear intentions which I am carrying into this relationship with the mushrooms.

Together with the mushroom, I want to reinvigorate my love for play. I get to build developer tools for a living! I work on the Internet! We are in the golden age of content; there are games to play, stories to discover. We haven't yet killed all of the nature, there is wilderness to enjoy. I want to bring a full, open heart to my hobbies. Play is a key ingredient in balance.

Together with the mushroom, I want others to know that when I am looking into their eyes I am hearing them. I am hearing them, feeling them and understanding them. I might not agree, but I will always listen and love.

Together with the mushroom, I will relax around people -- even the hyper-masculine, aggressive sort with which I grew. I will learn to understand that danger does _not_ lurk around every corner. I will learn that smiling at a stranger does not mean someone is going to smash my head with their fist.

Meditation is a powerful tool for a vibrant and healthy spirit. I can do all of this _without_ the mushroom. I am re-writing better patterns, one way or another. I can write them with a sober-mind; all of that and much more. My growth is just beginning -- with or without the mushroom. The meditative, sober mindset is one that builds respect. So too should the mindset of playful and formidable goofiness.

The mushroom is an ancient, silly, infinitely wise and emphatic presence. From it, I feel a child-like sense of wonderment. I am far from inebriated. I am lucid. I am _here_, not into the next thing. The wolves of the unknown lurk but their teeth aren't bared. They are happy and they want to join us.
