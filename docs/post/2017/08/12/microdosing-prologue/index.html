<p>Today, I embark on a partnership. For the foreseeable future, I will be taking 0.2 grams of Psilocybe semilanceata mushrooms every third evening. I&rsquo;d like to share why I&rsquo;ve begun this adventure, what I hope to achieve, and document my experiences living a modern life, working in a fast-paced tech start-up. My intention is to write an update once per week, observing and describing the short and long-term impact of a softening, Psilocybin-infused consciousness.</p>

<p>Two and a half years ago I had severe depression. To conquer the affliction, I deployed a variety of tools and tactics, with little respite. I meditated, with a determination that led me toÂ daily practice and the completion of a 10 day silent Vipassana program in the forested mountains of British Columbia. I exercised and played hockey at a high level. I self-medicated with Marijuana, positive for the symptoms. I visited a psychologist and - thankfully, briefly - took a course of anti-depressants.</p>

<p>I am a sensitive and introspective being. I&rsquo;ve come to understand that my depression was an appropriate reaction to the experiences that occurred during my youth. As an adult, the person that I became and the life that I had crafted was out of harmony with my true self. If you&rsquo;d have met me, you&rsquo;d have thought I was a bright and contended dude. Inside, I felt rotten. I was numb and miserable; my mind often engulfed with brutal imagery, encouraging me to kill myself, devilishly implying a horrible reality where no one could love me. It took an impossible, ecstatic, death-like experience in the Jungles of Peru to shake me out of a dark and suffocating rut. That rut had no future and I am forever grateful to who and what aided me.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Something left me in Peru. I returned home with an alien lightness. I couldn&rsquo;t believe the depression was gone. I felt, as old echoes of the disease ran their course, that my healing would be temporary. I have always been hyper-aware of &ldquo;pattern&rdquo;. In order to understand what led to my depression, I&rsquo;ve learned to apply my awareness of pattern to my own mind. Our personalities are complicated. The permutations we play out every day are an amalgam of the routines that we&rsquo;ve habituated throughout our cumulative existence. By the time you&rsquo;ve entered adulthood, the patterns of your character are deep. Your algorithms are complex, bugs and all.</p>

<p>The preferences that help you decide what you eat or drink, how you respond to ideas, thoughts, and emotions, even how you walk are carved into the depths of your mind. You have the power to re-write them. Nothing is forever. Your character is malleable. This reality is at the center of <em>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy</em> - or, CBT for short. CBT is the re-writing of your reactive thoughts through a volley of responses back and forth between you and your practitioner. Our thoughts colour how we evaluate the world and our words are representative of our thoughts. Lighter, happier, less-charged words, a lighter, happier, less-charged existence.</p>

<p>CBT in conjunction with anti-depressants is a way of reprogramming your brain. The anti-depressants provide the chemical grease, the CBT helps re-wire &ldquo;happier&rdquo; patterns. I am not a doctor and I do not provide medical advice. My thoughts on anti-depressants, through two decades of observing the suffering of a numb and sad loved-one, my personal experiences, and years of scientific research, have led me to believe that they should be avoided at all cost. These medicines damage the spirit in ways that we are unable to, or care not to, acknowledge or quantify. We do not yet know enough about what they do to carry such a cavalier and careless attitude towards their wide-spread consumption.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting words, fellow who is taking small amounts of a mysterious poop-growing fungus every other day&rdquo;, you cry! Shortly after taking anti-depressants, I felt them. Through introspection and meditation, I knew my mind well. When I began to feel them &ldquo;work&rdquo;, I became horrified. This was not <em>making me happier</em> or <em>helping me best depression</em>, this was suffocating my spirit and muting the wild colours of my mind: creative, spirited, tenacious; inoculated, subservient, dull. After stopping the pills, emotions returned and I felt an anger towards those who encouraged me to take the route of, what I consider now to be, castration of the soul. I understood why my physician warned that <em>&ldquo;things&rdquo;</em> would become worse before getting better, that suicidal thoughts may be expected: the screams of a wounded soul.</p>

<p>Two years after returning from the Jungle, I have become much more aware of the patterns that led to my depression. I understand what they are, where they came from, and what patterns are tied to the dark ones that no longer serve me well. Defensive responses, biases, and value-judgements become deeply routed; patterns are tricky because the deepest, slyest ones know how to hide. It takes a concerted and on-going effort to call yourself out on your own self-deception. Our egos are masters of self-deception. The self, as designed by the ego, is such a dense construct that we can spend a life-time unaware of its all-encompassing fiction. With a sober mind, it&rsquo;s been joyful blood, sweat, and tears writing a new story for myself.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve completely changed who I associate with. I&rsquo;ve made major adjustments to how I work. I&rsquo;ve let go of two failed founder-ships, failed academics, failed identities, and failed relationships. I understand who I am now and I love that person. I love someone who loves me back with unconditional love. I eat a healthy, mostly-plant diet. I exercise. I spend time with nature. I am outwardly joyful and, I am told, make others around me feel happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>But, there are many things I need help with. A casualty of over a decade of crippling and bleak depression was my sense of play. I&rsquo;d like to listen better, spend less time in my own head and engage others with a more open heart. I&rsquo;d like to visit social events without worry that someone is going to bash a crack into my skull &ndash; happened once, left a mark.</p>

<p>Together with the mushroom, I want to reinvigorate my love for play. I get to <a href="https://fly.io">build developer tools</a> for a living! I work on the Internet! We are in the golden age of content; there are <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com">games</a> to play, stories to discover. I want to bring a full, open heart to my hobbies. Play is a key ingredient in balance.</p>

<p>Together with the mushroom, I want others to know that when I am looking into their eyes I am hearing them. I am hearing them, feeling them, and understanding them. I might not agree, but I will always listen, and love.</p>

<p>Together with the mushroom, I will relax around people &ndash; even the hyper-masculine, aggressive sort that I grew with. I will learn to understand that danger does <em>not</em>, in fact, lurk around every corner. I will learn that smiling at a stranger does not mean someone is going to smash my head with their fist.</p>

<p>I can do all of this <em>without</em> the mushroom. Slowly, I was re-writing better patterns. I can write them with a sober-mind, on my own merit; all of that and more. Meditation is a powerful tool for a vibrant and healthy spirit. With or without the mushroom, my growth is just beginning. Today is the worst version of myself. The meditative, sober mindset is one that justifies respect. So, too, should the mindset of playful and formidable goofiness.</p>

<p>The mushroom is an ancient, silly, infinitely wise and emphatic presence. From it, I feel a child-like sense of wonderment. I am far from inebriated. I feel lucid. I am <em>here</em>, not into the next thing, not anywhere near the unrelenting flood of information that pulsates with mindless persistence through every channel I dare open. The wolves of the unknown lurk but their teeth aren&rsquo;t bared. They&rsquo;re happy and they want to join us.</p>
