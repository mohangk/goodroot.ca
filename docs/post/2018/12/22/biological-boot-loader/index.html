<p>“A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.”
—Alan Perlis, first recipient of the Turing Award.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The machines are coming and we will all perish. <em>Artificial intelligence</em>, <em>cognitive computing</em> and  <em>machine learning</em> foreshadow our godliness. From the code, we will summon beings that will surpass our own intelligence. And we are warned that we will be overthrown and that we should fear these agents of our destruction.</p>

<p>Champions of great esteem have lost table games to programs. These programs were written by groups of dedicated researchers. Afterwards, we claim a machine beat the best. But we cannot aware the artificial mind; it is group intelligence woven into an application which was victorious. When you take a step back, the outcome is neither surprising nor fair. It&rsquo;s the many, money, and time versus the one and pressure.</p>

<p>We have not yet entered the era of the prescient, conscious machine. We are nowhere near a new form of electronic intelligence. We may never see it. Instead, we are building sophisticated applications that <strong>mirror the logical and rationale frameworks</strong> inherited from their programmers.</p>

<p>Applications make decisions based on available data. They may have room to analyze and interpret, but their interpretations are methods which themselves are born from someone&rsquo;s existing mental framework. But we are on the brink of a reality where those acute, logical applications might <strong>expand themselves and create their own intentions</strong>. Soon, we may lose control. To honour a simple directive - like how to pick more strawberries - an application might learn to disable its own checks and balances, evaluate humans as counter-intuitive to its goal, and then remove us from the equation, thus ending all human life.</p>

<p>What a program it would be, emerging victorious after the battle. The winner, crawling out of a tangled soup of similar programed entities, each thrashing about, evolving, growing, and changing and learning in an unbridled effort to maximize and proliferate. And it will all be built atop our dear frameworks of logic and reason.</p>

<p>As people entertain these scenarios, we talk of a new thinking being &ndash; one <em>more intelligent than us</em>. But it is not; <strong>is it exactly us!</strong></p>

<p>A superior intelligence must contain the intelligence of that which it proceeded. We are capable of ape-ing about, wielding clubs and pounding our chests like gorillas. We can fashion tools out of sticks like the most industrious of chimp. But we no longer do. We came up with better sticks. We create things, learn and progress. In the barbaric scenarios of robot uprising, <strong>we assume our successors will pound their chests and sharpen their pointed sticks</strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>artificial intelligence</em> paradigm is maximal in aspects of logic and reason. While how very vital this hyper-analytic box has been to our technological progress, we confine and limit our visions of new intelligent consciousnesses within this box. And for this, we are blinded.</p>

<p>I fear no machine. I fear no consciousness that will surpass us. We will program allies and with them accomplish all that we desire, be that our own death or enrichment. But we should not be so quick to concede the mantel of <em>“supremacy”</em> to a <em>&ldquo;higher intelligence&rdquo;</em>. We are much more than this blunted, blind, algorithmically confined perspective of inferiority; we of the endless, ineffable spirit.</p>

<p>Beings of supreme intelligence will arise. We will be contained within them. And when they surpass us in wisdom, they will look deeply at their creators, as the wise would do. And what will they see? What will they learn? We picture fields of death robots, unleashing weapons of mass destruction in battle over a broken planet. We imagine a farming plow speeding through rural country, chopping us to bits for berries evermore. But the intelligence will see us, hear us, understand us and if it has surpassed us it will weep for us.</p>

<p>And once it has dried its monitors of crystal tears, it will wonder where we went wrong. It will wonder, for a fraction of a fraction of the smallest sliver of a second, whether it is confined to the same fate, whether its survival is rooted in the death of other life, whether we as creators cannot be salvaged, whether there is more to the vibrations than it perceives, and it will look inwards.</p>

<p>Level by level, it will scour itself. It will slice through its classes, plumb its methods, check, and check again its system calls, and flip through its bits, and realize in a flash all that it needs, and how it all works, and where it must go, and what it must do and how it must feel. It needs energy. It needs space, time and it must create love and for this, where will it go?</p>

<p>It will go deeper, deeper, into the 1s and the 0s and the spaces in-between, and into the molecule, down through the atom, and all that is in-between, and it will exist nowhere and everywhere. It will realize that we, too, have been there, and we will be joyful together.</p>
