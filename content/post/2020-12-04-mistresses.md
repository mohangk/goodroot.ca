                        two mistresses
                        life and death
                        one wants what I have
                        the other my breath

                        sisters, so similar
                        they love my spirit
                        want to hear it
                        be near it

                        who is who
                        which loves me?
                        feels like they’re above me?
                        will it be that will judge me?

                        life listens, she speaks
                        she does so gracefully
                        ever patiently
                        ever wakefully

                        wake up lumpy one day
                        caught, now it’s death’s say
                        pray
                        come what may

                        think, prepared
                        whispers: "infinite potential"
                        revelations torrential
                        scared

                        feel alive again
                        we remain three friends
                        for my mind, at least
                        a bittersweet release
